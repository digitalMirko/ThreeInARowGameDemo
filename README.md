Android(Java) - Three in a Row Game Demo

App created in Android Studio 3.5.3 using Java, Android Deployment Target API 19: Android 4.4(KitKat) and tested on a Nexus 5X API 29 Emulator

In this demo app we demonstrate how to code a 3 in a Row Game Demo App.

This layout uses a 3 x 3 grid where a person clicks and a colored (red or yellow) disc is dropped into place.
Once a 3 in the same row color is achieved a winner is announced and a message pops up at the top and a button is
displayed to restart the game.
